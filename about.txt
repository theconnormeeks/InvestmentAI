Using Python3.7 as the interpreter: /usr/bin/local/python3.7 (download from https://www.python.org)
VCS on Github: https://github.com/theconnormeeks
Alpha Vantage Stock Market API: https://www.alphavantage.co
#API key: 571I2OGDRCSK2904
local host: http://127.0.0.1:5000

external packages to install in terminal of PyCharm (might need to use sudo -H in front of these commands to bypass permissions)
Mac - these packages are stored within venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages
Windows - these packages are stored within venv/Windows/lib/site-packages

    pip install flask (micro web framework)
    pip install pandas (data analysis library)
    pip install matplotlib (for plotting graphs)
    pip install alpha_vantage (stock market API wrapper)

HTML files are within the templates folder in the same directory as the python file

WINDOWS:
Create a new Venv for Windows settings
Set interpreter to Windows venv path
Setup proxy in settings
Or just run pip install --proxy http://user:password@proxyserver:port flask
    FedEx username and password
    server:port = west.proxy.fedex.com:3128
IGNORE the two venv directory files (venv for mac and venv for windows) - you will have to pip install on each platform

Resolved the WinError 10061 - No Connection Could be made (max retries exceeded with url)
    Internet properties -> connections -> LAN Settings
    Use a proxy server for your LAN (fillout info), and bypass proxy server for local address

NOTE: have to update the python interpreter every time you make changes on a different Operating system (Mac vs Windows)
